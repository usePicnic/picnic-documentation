# Getting Started

## What is IndexPool?

IndexPool is a DeFi portfolio sharing protocol that enables you to **build or copy portfolios of DeFi investments in a single transaction**.

## How to copy a portfolio?

IndexPool enables you to **choose a portfolio you like and copy it entirely in just one transaction**. You can check a list of portfolios here.

Waiting for UI to be ready so we can take some screeshots and make a guide :D

## How to create a portfolio?

If there is no portfolio you would like to copy, you also have the option to set the desired allocations in our UI and to buy them with just one click. You can do it here.

## How to share a portfolio?

If you have a portfolio you like and would like to share, you can see all the portfolios you own here, just click in one of them and share the link so others will be able to copy it.
